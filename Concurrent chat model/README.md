# Concurrent chatbot model
### The concurrent chat model is an approach used in customer service and support systems that allows agents to handle multiple chat conversations at the same time. This model is particularly relevant in call centers or support centers where web chat is a mode of communication.
### The concurrent chat model is important because it directly impacts the operational costs and the quality of customer service. By optimizing the number of concurrent chats an agent can handle, organizations can ensure they provide timely support while maintaining a high standard of service.

# Some key aspects of concurrent chatbot model:-

## - Concurrency Rate:
### This is a measure of how many chat sessions an agent can handle simultaneously. It’s a crucial metric for planning and forecasting in a call center environment.
## - Average Handling Time (AHT):
### In the context of concurrent chats, AHT refers to the average duration an agent spends on a chat, including both the active chat time and the wrap-up time.
## - Efficiency:
### The concurrent chat model can significantly increase the efficiency of agents by allowing them to manage downtime in one chat (like waiting for a customer’s response) by engaging in another chat.
