# SOLID PRINCIPLES

 The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles that aim to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.
 #### In this File the 5 SOLID Principles will be acheived,applied and integrated together in the same code.


 # Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
 ### This principle states that a class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility. By following SRP, classes become easier to understand and maintain.
# Open/Closed Principle (OCP):
### According to this principle, software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means you should be able to add new functionality without changing existing code, which helps prevent bugs.
# Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):
### LSP states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program. This principle is fundamental for achieving polymorphism in object-oriented programming.
# Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):
### ISP suggests that no client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use. It promotes the segregation of interfaces so that they are more specific to client needs and don’t force clients to implement interfaces they don’t need.
# Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):
### DIP advises that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions. Additionally, abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions. This principle reduces the coupling between high-level and low-level modules.
